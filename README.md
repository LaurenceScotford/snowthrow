An HTML5 Christmas Game built with impact.js

**NOTE: Parts of this game are elements of the open source [Impact.js](https://github.com/phoboslab/Impact) framework.**
**This game includes code for linking to a leaderboard on [clay.io](http://clay.io/), but this has not been tested with recent versions of clay.io and would require an active clay.io game key and ID to function**

This is a simple, silly Christmas game in which you are in a snowball fight with Santa's elves. Use your mouse to target an elf and then click the left button to throw a snowball. You need to hit the elves quickly before they have a chance to throw a snowball back at you. You start with 12 lives and your aim is to get as high a score as possible before your lives run out.
